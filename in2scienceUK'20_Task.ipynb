        "\n",
        "The goals of this tutorial are:\n",
        "* to give you an opportunity to think about, and engage in, science on a deep level\n",

One might imagine how such directional control could be achieved through asymmetric activation of the central pattern generators in the spinal cord. Indeed, experiments on reduced preparations, such as an extruded spinal cord in a dish, have supported the existence of such asymmetrically controllable modules. Furthermore, anatomical data has suggested a specific class of neurons in the gigantocellular nucleus (Gi) of the reticular formation as plausible generators of the aforementioned asymmetry. \n",

Thus, the mouse was made to express a specific receptor (hM3Dq) selectively in the Gi neurons of interest on _one side_ (right side) of the brain. When activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), this receptor excites the respective neurons, making them fire action potentials. \n",
