Materials used in a teaching module on neural control of locomotion as part of the in2scienceUK'20 virtual programme.

The images on turning behaviour are from this important work: [Cregg JM, Leiras R, Montalant A, Wanken P, Wickersham IR, Kiehn O (2020). **Brainstem neurons that command mammalian locomotor asymmetries**. _Nat Neurosci._ 23(6):730-740](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0633-7). The data are also modelled based on the findings in this same paper. 
I neither own nor claim any right to this paper. The sole purpose of these materials is to inspire the students taking part into the in2scienceUK'20 virtual programme by giving them an opportunity to analyse data and think about exciting cutting-edge science.
